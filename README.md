I. Design Philosophy

Website Colors

Red – Radiates passion and technology which WinDev is driven for the passion to provide accessible quality technology at an affordable price where people can access technology delivered right at the palm of their own hands.

White – The color white (found in areas of the website) represent purity and a fresh start for the startup; its goals, missions and visions

Dark – A norm of developers where their default theme is dark as they always work at night.

Website Theme: Laptop Backgrounds – The laptop backgrounds describe the services offered of WinDev which are software development services (most of the laptops contain code).

Website Logo: The website logo adapts the website colors and their corresponding meanings.

II. Code Structure Design (Highlights)

Navigation Bar: The header and navigation bar were made with displays of flex and block, respectively. It was positioned and hidden beyond the view of the webpage through negative units. Then were given special elements with webkits, transforms and box-shadows. The code of the head and navigation bar could be found in navbar.css on the root of the project and was used universally throughout the project for simplicity. The navigation bar is made as a hamburger menu and the footer is placed at the bottom by being structured at the bottom of the HTML.

Centered Elements Every Page – Each webpage on the website was centered using flexboxes giving them center elements of justify-content and align-items. Responsiveness – Most elements use a display of flex that are either row or column and wrapped to adapt responsiveness. Viewport units together with minimum and maximum heights and widths are also used so that elements will adjust as the screen resizes.

Backgrounds of Major Elements – Backgrounds of major elements such as buttons, long texts and forms were given the default colors of the website, rounder corners and light box-shadows upon hover.

Forms – The forms adapt the design of the background of major elements. It has a box-shadow on hover to the main form and on individual text boxes, dropdowns, and buttons.

Forms Submit Button – Post method is used for added security as sensitive data given by the clien is received. Information is hidden from
the address bar opposite to the counterpart method.

Footer – The footer contains the description of the website, links that route similar to the navigation bar on the header, disclaimer notice and copyright notice at the bottom. The footer is layouted with a display of flex, its flex-flow of row wrap, and centered through justify-contents and
align-items.

III. Welcome Page

WinDev tagline – “Technology in the Palm of your Hands”; the tagline is adapted from the line of Dr. Octopus from the film; Spiderman: Now Way Home. The modified tagline has a personal connection to CEO as it means the envisioning of a future where each citizen starting from Filipinos would have access to technology for their own benefit, right in the palm of their own hands.

Website Description – WinDev: Web, game, and app development services.
